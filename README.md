# Social Media & Data Mining Mining
This repository contains the code I created in the Social Media and Data Mining Course

## How to install and run
1. Download/Clone repository
2. Make sure __PyCharm__ is installed on your computer
3. Open the project you would like to see in the PyCharm IDE


## API Clarifications:
1. Some of the projects may require an API key that you can get by making an account on developer.twitter.com and creating an app
2. After creating the app, we get four numbers. Import those four numbers into a config.py file that is in the same directory as the project you are trying to operate.
3. This precaution was taken so that no API keys would be leaked online.
